# About This Repo
This was born as a Christmas Playground Project (CPP) to explore the Zed editor and its AI agent integration. Pretty much all of the contents were generated by AI agents (Gemini 3, Claude Sonnet 4.5) via Github Copilot and only manually modified where AI let me down.

The main goal was to learn how to use Zed and how well it could be used as daily driver for coding - and also how its AI integration works.

# Starfield Simulation

A Java-based starfield animation with native macOS fullscreen support.

## Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
mvn package
```

This will create an executable JAR file in the `target` directory.

## Running

To run the application using Maven:

```bash
mvn exec:exec
```

Or run the built JAR file directly:

```bash
java --add-exports java.desktop/com.apple.eawt=ALL-UNNAMED \
     -jar target/starfield4j-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Fullscreen Support

### macOS
On macOS, the application supports native fullscreen mode with smooth animations:

- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Cmd+Ctrl+F`
- **Mouse**: Click the green fullscreen button in the window title bar

The native fullscreen mode moves the window to a separate Space with the standard macOS animation.

### Important Note for Java 9+
The `--add-exports java.desktop/com.apple.eawt=ALL-UNNAMED` flag is required to access macOS-specific APIs in Java 9 and later versions. Without this flag, the application will fall back to borderless fullscreen mode instead of the native macOS fullscreen.
The Maven `exec:exec` goal is configured to include this flag automatically.

## Requirements

- Java 25 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- macOS (for native fullscreen support)

## Features

- 2000 animated stars creating a 3D depth effect
- Smooth animation at ~100 FPS
- Native macOS fullscreen support with keyboard shortcut
